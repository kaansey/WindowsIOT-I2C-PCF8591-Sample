# Windows IOT I2C Project With PCF8591 (ADC)

###Raspberry pi-2
 - Reading data from Infrared Proximity Sensor Long Range - Sharp GP2Y0A02YK0F with ADC converter (PCF8591).
 - Receiving Voltage from Infrared Proximity Sensor between the  0 - 5 Depending to range.

###PCF8591
 The PCF8591 has a 4-channel, 8-bit analog input port and a single channel analog output port.

###Sharp GP2Y0A02YK0F
 Description: Infrared proximity sensor made by Sharp. Part # GP2Y0A02YK0F has an analog output that varies from 2.8V at 15cm to 0.4V at 150cm with a supply voltage between 4.5 and 5.5VDC. The sensor has a Japanese Solderless Terminal (JST) Connector. We recommend purchasing the related pigtail below or soldering wires directly to the back of the module.
 This sensor is great for sensing objects up to 5 feet away!
